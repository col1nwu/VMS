# Vehicle Monitoring System

### PUP-2, 2021 Capstone Project

#### Agricultural and Biological Engineering Department, Purdue University

In the first part, the team creates data fetchers to integrate data collected from
different sensors. The goal of this part is to collect data and output data in a readable and processable format for
storage (in charge of PUP-1) and analysis.


**Data fetchers**:
- GPS
- Engine temperature
- Engine RPM

In the second part of this project, the team analyzes the raw data and
interacts with the driver about the vehicle status and routing.

**Data analysis features**:
- Distance calculator
- Status checker
- Trendline generator
- Simple UI (potential feature)

If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to contact us. We are always happy to help and improve our code.
