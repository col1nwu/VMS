# Vehicle Monitoring System

### PUP-2, 2021 Capstone Project

#### Agricultural and Biological Engineering Department, Purdue University

In the first part, the team creates data fetchers to integrate data collected from
different sensors. The goal of this part is to collect data from different sources and output data in a readable and
processable format for storage (currently in charge of PUP-1) and analysis.


**Data Acquisition**:
- GPS
- Engine temperature
- Engine RPM

In the second part of this project, the team analyzes the raw data and
interacts with the driver about the vehicle status and routing.

**Data analysis features**:
- Distance calculator
- Status checker
- Trendline generator
- Simple UI (potential feature)

**How to Use this project?**
- Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
- Go inside the directory.
- Type "./driver.sh" to run the project.
- To stop the project, type "Ctrl-C" and "python3 stop.py" in order to kill all processes.

**Prerequisite of Your Local Machine**
- Install the required Python modules: GPS
- To acquire GPS and RPM data, users need to configure the Linux system based on the tutorials provided for each data
  acquisition tools.
